# A Convolution Model for Analyzing the Effect of Physical Activity on Interstitial Glucose

## UNCG REU 2024

More than one-third of Americans suffer from prediabetes, a medical condition with a 10\% annual probability of developing into Type II diabetes. Monitoring the patient's interstitial glucose level is crucial for mitigating the impact of prediabetes on patients' glycemic health. While the current literature focuses on the long-term impact of exercises on blood glucose levels of Type II diabetes patients, our research provides a method to analyze short-term impact of physical activities on glycemic variability. Specifically, we apply the generalized additive model to study the relationship between activity duration and the fluctuations in glucose level in the one hour following the activity period for prediabetes patients. The insights into this relationship are crucial for developing personalized healthcare recommendations that fit the unique needs and capabilities of each patient. We developed a novel nonparametric method for statistical learning of the functional form of the effects of physical activity on glycemic variability through the generalized additive models.
